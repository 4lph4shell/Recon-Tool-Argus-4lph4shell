## üìñ Usage

Argus offers a rich collection of tools categorized into three main areas:

### Network & Infrastructure Tools

These tools help you gather data about a network, uncovering vital details about servers, IP addresses, DNS records, and more:

1. **Associated Hosts**: Discover domains associated with the target.
2. **DNS Over HTTPS**: Resolve DNS securely via encrypted channels.
3. **DNS Records**: Collect DNS records, including A, AAAA, MX, etc.
4. **DNSSEC Check**: Verify if DNSSEC is properly configured.
5. **Domain Info**: Gather information such as registrar details and expiry dates.
6. **Domain Reputation Check**: Check domain trustworthiness using various reputation sources.
7. **IP Info**: Retrieve geographic and ownership details of an IP address.
8. **Open Ports Scan**: Scan the target for open ports and services.
9. **Server Info**: Extract key server details using various techniques.
10. **Server Location**: Identify the physical location of the server.
11. **SSL Chain Analysis**: Analyze the SSL certificate chain for trustworthiness.
12. **SSL Expiry Alert**: Check SSL certificates for upcoming expiry.
13. **TLS Cipher Suites**: List the supported TLS ciphers on the server.
14. **TLS Handshake Simulation**: Simulate a TLS handshake to check for security issues.
15. **Traceroute**: Trace the path packets take to reach the target.
16. **TXT Records**: Fetch TXT records, often used for verification purposes.
17. **WHOIS Lookup**: Perform WHOIS queries to gather domain ownership details.
18. **Zone Transfer**: Attempt to perform DNS zone transfers.
19. **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support Checker**: Check if the server supports HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

### Web Application Analysis Tools

These modules focus on understanding the structure and security of web applications:

20. **Archive History**: View the target's history using internet archives.
21. **Broken Links Detection**: Find broken links that may lead to user frustration or security gaps.
22. **Carbon Footprint**: Evaluate the environmental impact of a website.
23. **CMS Detection**: Detect the type of CMS used, like WordPress, Joomla, etc.
24. **Cookies Analyzer**: Analyze cookies for secure attributes and potential privacy issues.
25. **Content Discovery**: Discover hidden directories, files, and endpoints.
26. **Crawler**: Crawl the site to uncover data and map out its structure.
27. **Robots.txt Analyzer**: Analyze the `robots.txt` file for hidden resources.
28. **Directory Finder**: Look for directories that may not be indexed publicly.
29. **Email Harvesting**: Extract email addresses from the target domain.
30. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the website's response time and load performance.
31. **Quality Metrics**: Assess the quality of the site's content and user experience.
32. **Redirect Chain**: Follow redirects to analyze if they're safe or malicious.
33. **Sitemap Parsing**: Extract URLs from the site's sitemap.
34. **Social Media Presence Scan**: Analyze the social media profiles linked to the target.
35. **Technology Stack Detection**: Identify the technologies and frameworks the site uses.
36. **Third-Party Integrations**: Discover any third-party services integrated into the site.

### Security & Threat Intelligence Tools

The security modules in Argus are designed to assess the target's defenses and gather threat intelligence:

37. **Censys Reconnaissance**: Use Censys for in-depth details about the target's assets.
38. **Certificate Authority Recon**: Examine the certificate authority details.
39. **Data Leak Detection**: Check for potential data leaks and sensitive data exposure.
40. **Exposed Environment Files Checker**: Identify publicly exposed `.env` files.
41. **Firewall Detection**: Identify whether a firewall or WAF is protecting the target.
42. **Global Ranking**: Look up the site's global ranking to gauge its popularity.
